# Jersey Images

Please replace these placeholder SVG files with the actual jersey images you provided:

## Required Files:
- `blue-jersey.png` - Blue jersey with yellow accents and black stripe
- `golden-jersey.png` - Golden yellow jersey with dark green accents and marble pattern  
- `red-jersey.png` - Red jersey with white number and dark accents

## Instructions:
1. Save your jersey images with the exact filenames listed above
2. Place them in this `/public/jerseys/` directory
3. The images should be PNG format with transparent background
4. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger for crisp display
5. Ensure the images have transparent backgrounds (no white or colored backgrounds)

## Current Status:
The application is now configured to use actual image files instead of custom SVG designs. 

**IMPORTANT**: Replace the current placeholder SVG files with your actual jersey photos to see the real jersey designs in the dropdown preview and canvas rendering.

## Temporary Placeholders:
Currently using simple colored rectangles with text labels as placeholders. These will be replaced once you add your actual jersey images.
