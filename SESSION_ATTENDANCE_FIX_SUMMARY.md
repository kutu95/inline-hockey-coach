# Session Attendance Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The save attendance page was experiencing two main issues:

1. **HTTP 409 Conflict Error** when trying to save attendance data
2. **Network connectivity errors** (`ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`) during auth token refresh

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch
- The `sessions` table has been updated to include an `organization_id` column for multi-tenant support
- However, the RLS (Row Level Security) policies for `session_attendance` were still using the old single-tenant logic that checks for `coach_id`
- This mismatch caused the RLS policies to fail, resulting in the 409 conflict error

### 2. Unique Constraint Issues
- The `session_attendance` table has a unique constraint on `(session_id, player_id)`
- The original code was using individual upsert operations in a loop, which could cause race conditions and constraint violations

### 3. Network Error Handling
- Poor error handling for network issues made it difficult for users to understand what went wrong
- No retry mechanism for recoverable network errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated SessionAttendance Component (`components/SessionAttendance.jsx`)
- **Improved attendance saving logic**: Changed from individual upsert operations to a single batch upsert with proper conflict handling
- **Better error handling**: Added specific error messages for different error types (409, 42501, 23505)
- **Network error recovery**: Added retry mechanism for network connectivity issues
- **Enhanced UI**: Added loading spinners, better error/success messages, and retry buttons
- **Proper conflict resolution**: Used `onConflict: 'session_id,player_id'` to handle the unique constraint properly
- **Multi-tenant only**: Removed all `coach_id` logic and focused on organization-based access control

### 2. Created RLS Policy Fix Script (`fix-session-attendance-rls.sql`)
- **Updated session_attendance RLS policies**: Modified to support multi-tenant organization-based access only
- **Updated sessions RLS policies**: Ensured sessions table policies also support organization-based access only
- **Proper permission checks**: Policies now check `organization_id` through user roles exclusively

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Run the RLS Policy Fix Script
Execute the `fix-session-attendance-rls.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor to update the RLS policies:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
\i fix-session-attendance-rls.sql
```

### 2. Test the Fix
1. Navigate to the save attendance page
2. Try to save attendance data
3. Verify that the 409 conflict error is resolved
4. Test with multi-tenant organization scenarios

### 3. Monitor for Issues
- Watch for any remaining RLS policy errors
- Monitor network connectivity issues
- Check that attendance data is being saved correctly

## Technical Details

### RLS Policy Changes
The new policies check for access using organization-based permissions only:
- **Multi-tenant access**: `sessions.organization_id IN (SELECT organization_id FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid())`
- **No coach_id checks**: All policies now exclusively use organization-based access control

### Attendance Saving Logic
- **Before**: Individual upsert operations in a loop (prone to race conditions)
- **After**: Single batch upsert with proper conflict resolution using `onConflict: 'session_id,player_id'`

### Error Handling Improvements
- **Specific error codes**: 409 (Conflict), 42501 (Permission denied), 23505 (Unique violation)
- **Network error detection**: Automatic retry mechanism for network issues
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear explanations of what went wrong and how to fix it

## Expected Results
After applying these fixes:
1. ✅ HTTP 409 conflict errors should be resolved
2. ✅ Attendance data should save successfully
3. ✅ Better error messages for troubleshooting
4. ✅ Automatic retry for network issues
5. ✅ Support for multi-tenant organization-based scenarios only

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist:
1. Check the Supabase logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that the RLS policies were applied correctly
3. Ensure the user has proper roles and permissions within their organization
4. Check that the sessions table has the expected structure with `organization_id` column
5. Verify that the user has a valid `organization_id` in their `user_roles` table
