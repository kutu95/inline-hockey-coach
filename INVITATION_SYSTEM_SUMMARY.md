# Invitation-Based User Registration System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented an invitation-based user registration system for your inline hockey coach application. This system replaces the open registration with a secure, admin-controlled invitation process.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Changes**
- **New `invitations` table** with secure tokens, expiration dates, and acceptance tracking
- **Added `user_id` column** to `players` table to link players to auth users
- **RLS policies** for secure access control
- **Token generation function** for secure invitation links

### 2. **Email Integration with Resend**
- **Professional email templates** with your branding
- **Secure invitation links** with 7-day expiration
- **Password reset emails** using the same system
- **Error handling** for email delivery issues

### 3. **User Flow**

#### For Administrators:
1. Add a player through the existing "Add Player" form
2. Include the player's email address
3. Check "Send Account Invitation" checkbox
4. Player receives a professional invitation email
5. Player can set up their own account and password

#### For Players:
1. Receive invitation email with secure link
2. Click link to access invitation acceptance page
3. Set their own password (minimum 6 characters)
4. Automatically assigned 'player' role
5. Can view their own profile, sessions, and drills

### 4. **Security Features**
- **Cryptographically secure tokens** for invitations
- **7-day expiration** on all invitations
- **One-time use** invitations (marked as accepted)
- **Automatic role assignment** (player role)
- **Data isolation** - players only see their own data

### 5. **Player Access**
Players can now:
- View their own player profile (`/player-profile`)
- Access sessions and drills
- See their club and squad information
- View their personal details and contact information

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env` file:

   -- Execute supabase-migration-invitations.sql in Supabase SQL editor
   ```

2. **Set Up Resend**:
   - Create account at resend.com

   - Set your site URL

4. **Test the System**:
   - Add a test player with your email
   - Check invitation email
   - Accept invitation and set password
   - Verify player access

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Only invited users can create accounts
2. **Control**: Administrators control who gets access
3. **Professional**: Branded email invitations
4. **User-Friendly**: Players set their own passwords
5. **Scalable**: Easy to invite multiple players
6. **Auditable**: Track invitation status and acceptance

## Player Experience

Once a player accepts an invitation:
- They get the 'player' role automatically
- Can view their own profile at `/player-profile`
- Can access sessions and drills
- See their club and squad information
- All data is properly isolated and secure

## Admin Experience

Administrators can:
- Add players with invitation option
- Track invitation status
- Manage player access through roles
- Send invitations to existing players

This system provides a secure, professional way to onboard players while maintaining full administrative control over who can access the platform.
